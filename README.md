# CarbScan-Self-Checkout-Machine
A roblox studio free self checkout machine

You can get the model in the release or the toolbox for a more stable but less updated version

This will be a long list on how to use this model

First put the CarbScanSettings folder in Replicated Storage
Like This:

Make sure you are putting it in Replicated **Storage** not _Replicated First_

To make your tool compatible make 2 String values and put them at the root of your tool, _not sure what a root is?, look [here](https://imgur.com/a/mmvWcQo)_

Name 1 string value "Object" and the other one "Price", change the values in the properties tab to what you want

Optionally you can add a Bool Value named "HasBeenBought" for the implementation of [CarbAlarm](https://github.com/artlurg431/CarbAlarm---Auto-Store-Alarm) in the future for now you dont _need_ to put it in
but if your planning on using [CarbAlarm](https://github.com/artlurg431/CarbAlarm---Auto-Store-Alarm) then you do put it in.

Settings

Settings are used for, well setting up the item, the values in the settings can be changed easily and dont require coding skills to change

Here you can see different variables available for us to change
Owners name should be changed to your name, but is not nesseccary

Allowed objects are the objects that can be scanned, remember the _Object_ string value you created? go back and see what you named the value on it, the table here in the Allowed objects is looking
for the names of the value of the Object string value, the value of your _Object_ should be written down there like it shows in the picture

That is the **Bare** minimum to get this product set up, _still confused? [check out my video here](https://youtu.be/boNGEnkyBzE)_
